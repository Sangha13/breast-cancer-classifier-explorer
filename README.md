# 🧠 ML Classifier Explorer

A modular and interactive Streamlit application for exploring and comparing machine learning classifiers — **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Decision Tree** — using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.

The app allows users to experiment with different hyperparameters, visualize decision boundaries, evaluate model performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves, and explore the dataset through a dedicated EDA dashboard. Designed for students, data science learners, and ML enthusiasts to intuitively understand classification models and their trade-offs.

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

This project mimics real-world workflows used by data scientists and healthcare analysts for early diagnosis of diseases like cancer. By comparing classification models on real diagnostic data, this app helps in:

- 🧠 Understanding how model decisions impact medical diagnosis  
- ⚖️ Visualizing trade-offs between accuracy, precision, and recall  
- 🧹 Demonstrating the importance of data preprocessing and feature selection  
- 🏥 Serving as a foundation for deploying AI-based diagnostic tools  

While the current implementation is educational, the same techniques are used in **clinical decision support systems**, **predictive healthcare**, and **AI model explainability** in regulated domains.
